This is the visual implementation of A* path finding algorithm using pygame module.

A star, also known as A*, is a popular algorithm used for pathfinding in video games and other applications. It is an example of a heuristic search algorithm, meaning that it uses an estimate of the distance to the goal to guide the search for the most efficient path.

The A star algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes, which represent the possible paths that the algorithm is exploring. At each step, the algorithm selects the node that is closest to the goal, based on an estimate of the distance to the goal known as the heuristic. The algorithm then expands this node to find its neighbors, and repeats the process until the goal is reached or there are no more nodes to explore.

This is a guided project with techwithtim.
